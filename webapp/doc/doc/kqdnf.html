wife is WuSong.<br>
(指着上台处的门大声道)I’m not afraid of you!<br>
(内砸出一脸盆,Ｊ接住当成盾牌护着头)Then, I’m afraid of whom?<br>
My wife Lunch is the most famous woman in the neighbor-hood.She is braver than me,
smarter than me and stronger than me.All this I donot care.I only want her to be tender
than me.But she is not !Having a wife like this is just like living in the hell!
